# Todo App cmd Line Practice
- - -
## Description:
This is a python project where I'm trying to do the very basic todo-like app but on the command line as an interface.

### Purpose:
This is for practice. I haven't coded in python in a while and I need to practice.

### Expected Outcome:
By revisiting python basics, I'll be able to skill up towards more advanced topics and project ideas.

## Usage
1. Clone this repo down to your local machine using the command in terminal:
```bash
git clone [Repo URL]
```

2. Start the app by using the python command in terminal:
```bash 
    python3 main.py
```
